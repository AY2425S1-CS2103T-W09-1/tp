* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>

  Example usages:

  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)

  * as a case study

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.

  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.

  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.

* This is **a brownfield team project done by Software Engineering students from the National University of Singapore (NUS)**.<br>
* The project has adapted an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**.
  * It now functions as a tool for interviewers to manage details of interviewees.
* It is named `HiredFiredPro`.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HiredFiredPro Website](http://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w09-1.github.io/tp)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
